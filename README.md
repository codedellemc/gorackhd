### Go bindings for RackHD

## Description
gorackhd represents API bindings for Go that allow you to manage [RackHD](https://github.com/RackHD/RackHD). The intended functions are a direct implementation of what's available within the RackHD API.

## Compatibility
gorackhd is created using [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) client generator. 

The client relies on a swagger spec file that is taken from RackHD's [on-http](https://github.com/RackHD/on-http) library and packaged at `/swagger-spec/monorail.yml`. As the swagger spec changes, this client will update as needed. 

## Installation & Creation of the Client
The client is found within the `/client` folder which is generated by go-swagger. To generate/install the client:
```
$ go get github.com/emccode/gorackhd
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/emccode/gorackhd
$ make
```

The Makefile utilizes [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to reference git commit `bb86d63b17` of [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) that has been tested and known to be working. The Makefile will generate a go-swagger directory in `/vendor/github.com/` and then create the client. 

## Environment Variables
| Name        | Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `GORACKHD_ENDPOINT`      | the API endpoint. `localhost:9090` is used by default if not set             |


## Using the client

This sample script will retrieve (GET) all nodes. Take a look at `gorackhd_test.go` for more

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"

    //swagclient "github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/client"
    httptransport "github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/httpkit/client"
    "github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/strfmt"

    apiclient "github.com/emccode/gorackhd/client"
    "github.com/emccode/gorackhd/client/nodes"
)

func main() {

    // create the transport
    transport := httptransport.New("localhost:9090", "/api/1.1", []string{"http"})

    // If not using the Vagrant image, set this environment variable to something other than localhost:9090
    if os.Getenv("GORACKHD_ENDPOINT") != "" {
        transport.Host = os.Getenv("GORACKHD_ENDPOINT")
    }

    // create the API client, with the transport
    client := apiclient.New(transport, strfmt.Default)

    //use any function to do REST operations
    resp, err := client.Nodes.GetNodes(nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("%#v\n", resp.Payload)

}

```

### Use the client to create (POST) a new item
Import the library for what you are trying to post:
```
import (
    ...
    "github.com/emccode/gorackhd/client/nodes"
    ...
)
```

Create the JSON struct
```
type ObmConfig struct {
    Host     string `json:"host"`
    User     string `json:"user"`
    Password string `json:"password"`
}

type ObmSettings struct {
    Service string     `json:"service"`
    Config  *ObmConfig `json:"config"`
}

type Node struct {
    ID          string         `json:"id"`
    Name        string         `json:"name"`
    Type        string         `json:"type"`
    ObmSettings []*ObmSettings `json:"obmSettings"`
}
```


```
    c := &Node{
        ID:   "1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd",
        Name: "somename",
        Type: "compute",
        ObmSettings: []*ObmSettings{&ObmSettings{
            Service: "ipmi-obm-service",
            Config: &ObmConfig{
                Host:     "1.2.3.4",
                User:     "myuser",
                Password: "mypass",
            },
        }},
    }

    resp, err := client.Nodes.PostNodes(&nodes.PostNodesParams{Identifiers: c})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("%#v\n", resp.Payload)
```

### Use the client to fetch (GET) individual items

Import the library for what you are trying to retrieve:
```
import (
    ...
    "github.com/emccode/gorackhd/client/nodes"
    ...
)
```

Lookup the params that are required in a struct:
```
resp, err := client.Skus.GetSkusIdentifier(&nodes.GetNodesIdentifierParams{Identifier: "1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd"})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("%#v\n", resp.Payload)

```

### Use the client to remove (DELETE) individual items
Import the library for what you are trying to retrieve:
```
import (
    ...
    "github.com/emccode/gorackhd/client/nodes"
    ...
)
```

Lookup the params that are required in a struct:
```
resp, err := client.Nodes.DeleteNodesIdentifier(&nodes.DeleteNodesIdentifierParams{Identifier: "1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd"})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("%#v\n", resp)
```

## Future
- Add documentation to show examples of the main API calls needed for administration. This includes GET/PUT/POST/DELETE for Skus, Workflows, & Catalogs.

## Contribution
Create a fork of the project into your own repository. 

Run the tests provided in `gorackhd_test.go` to verify GET/POST/DELETE still function:
```
env DEBUG=1 go test -run TestNodePostOperation -v
env DEBUG=1 go test -run TestNodeGetOperation -v
env DEBUG=1 go test -run TestNodeDeleteOperation -v
```

If tests do not pass, please create an issue so it can be addressed or fix and create a PR.

If all tests pass, make changes and create a pull request with a description on what was added or removed and details explaining the changes in lines of code. If approved, project owners will merge it.
